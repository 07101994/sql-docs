# Job History - HDInsight Region Developer Dashboard (Analytics Platform System)
Use the Job History page of the HDInsight Developer Dashboard to monitor the status of current and previous jobs. The Job History page uses the **WebHCat** tool to monitor the status of current and previous jobs. The Job History page displays the name, type, and arguments for each job, along with the start time and status. The information is taken directly from WedHCat job details.  
  
## Job History (WebHCat)
