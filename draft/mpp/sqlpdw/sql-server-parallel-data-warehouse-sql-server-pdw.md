# SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse (SQL Server PDW)
SQL Server PDW runs as a workload on Analytics Platform System. Use SQL Server PDW as the core relational data warehousing component of your end-to-end business intelligence solutions.

## SQL Server PDW Benefits  
With PDW’s massively parallel processing (MPP) design, queries commonly complete 50 times faster than traditional data warehouses built on symmetric multi-processing (SMP) database management systems.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> 50 times faster means that queries complete in minutes instead of hours, or seconds instead of minutes. With this breakthrough performance, your business analysts can generate more extensive results faster, and can easily perform ad-hoc queries or drill down into the details. As a result, your business can make better decisions, faster.  
  
In addition to achieving breakthrough query performance, PDW makes it easy to:  
  
-   Grow your data warehouse to anywhere from a few terabytes to over 6 petabytes of data in a single appliance by adding “scale units” to your existing system  
  
-   Trust your data will be there when you need it because of the built- in high redundancy and high availability,  
  
-   Solve modern data challenges of loading and consolidating data  
  
-   Integrate Hadoop data with relational data for fast analysis by using PDW’s highly parallelized PolyBase technology  
  
-   Use Business Intelligence tools to build comprehensive end-to-end solutions.
