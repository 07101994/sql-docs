# Query (SQL Server PDW)
To write and tune queries, SQL Server PDW provides several tools and processes, which are outlined in the following sections.  
  
## Writing Queries  
To query your SQL Server PDW databases, you can use the SQL Server PDWSQL language. Queries can be submitted to SQL Server PDW either through SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio, or through the sqlcmd command-line tool. For more information about how to install and use these tools, see the following:  
  
-   [Client Tools and Applications &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/client-tools-and-applications-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
To use the SQL language statements, the SQL Server PDW system views, and the SQL Server views, see the following reference sections:  
  
-   [SQL Reference &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/sql-reference-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
-   [System Views &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/system-views-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
For information on using prepared statements, see the following:  
  
-   [Running Prepared Statements &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/running-prepared-statements-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
## Tuning Queries  
To view the query plan, use the EXPLAIN command. This will allow you to see what steps the query will process without running the query. For more information, see the following:  
  
-   [Understanding Query Plans &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/understanding-query-plans-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
-   [EXPLAIN &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/explain-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
## Monitoring Queries  
You can monitor active and recent queries to see the processing time required for each step and other metadata. For more information, see the following:  
  
-   [Monitoring Active Queries &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/monitoring-active-queries-sql-server-pdw.md)
