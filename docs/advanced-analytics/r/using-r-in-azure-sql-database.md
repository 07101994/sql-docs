# Using R in Azure SQL Database

In October 2017, the SQL Server development team announced plans to support execution of R code in-database using stored procedures, similar to R Services in SQL Server 2016. This feature is still under development.

To keep up to date on the public release schedule and upcoming events, see the [SQL Server blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/) or the [Microsoft R Server blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rserver/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The initial preview release that was announced was intended for testing and exploration only. Currently, the feature is available in Azure SQL Database in limited regions only, and features are limited in comparison with the features supported in SQL Server 2016 or 2017.

**Azure resources**

In the meantime, we recommend that you use one of the SQL Server 2017 virtual machines that are available on the Azure Marketplace: 

+ [Provision a virtual machine for machine learning on Azure](provision-the-r-server-only-sql-server-2016-enterprise-vm-on-azure.md)

Also check out these VMs, which come preconfigured with a variety of popular machine learning tools:

+ [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)
+ [Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/deep-learning-dsvm-overview),
