     [Modify the user account pool for SQL Server R Services--../r/modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md)

If you are using SQL Server Standard Edition and do not have resource governor, you can use dynamic management views and extended events to help you manage server resources. You can also use Windows event monitoring for this purpose. For more information, see [Monitoring and managing R Services--../r/managing-and-monitoring-r-solutions.md).

**Upgrade the machine learning components**


When you install Machine Learning Services by using SQL Server 2017, you get the version of the components at the time the release was published. Each time you patch or upgrade the SQL Server instance, the machine learning components are upgraded as well.

You can upgrade the machine learning components on a faster schedule than is supported by SQL Server releases, by installing Microsoft Machine Learning Server. When you do so, you also get any new features supported in the latest release of Machine Learning Server, such as:

+ Updates to Python packages for [revoscalepy](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/python-reference/revoscalepy/revoscalepy-package) and [microsoftml for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/python-reference/microsoftml/microsoftml-package).
+ [Pretrained models](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/install/microsoftml-install-pretrained-models) for image classification and text analysis.

For information about how to upgrade an instance, see [Upgrade R components through binding--..\r\use-sqlbindr-exe-to-upgrade-an-instance-of-sql-server.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The current release version contains the latest version of all machine learning components. Therefore, although upgrades via Microsoft Machine Learning Server are supported for SQL Server 2017, the upgrade that is currently available applies only to SQL Server 2016 instances.

**Boost performance and scale**


Although the open source R language is known to have limitations, the RevoScaleR package APIs can operate on large datasets and benefit from multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-process in-database computations.

If your R solution uses complex aggregations or involves large datasets, you can leverage SQL Server's highly efficient in-memory aggregations and columnstore indexes, and let the R code handle the statistical computations and scoring.

Both the RevoScaleR and MicrosoftML packages were used to train a predictive model in a complex R solution involving large datasets. SQL queries and R code were identical. All tests were conducted on a single Azure VM with SQL Server installed. The author then compared scoring times with and without these optimizations provided by SQL Server:

- In-memory tables
- Soft-NUMA
- Resource Governor

To assess the effect of soft-NUMA on R script execution, the data science team tested the solution on an Azure virtual machine with 20 physical cores. On these physical cores, four soft-NUMA nodes were created automatically, such that each node contained five cores.

CPU affinitization was enforced in the resume-matching scenario, to assess the impact on R jobs. Four **SQL resource pools** and four **external resource pools** were created, and CPU affinity was specified to ensure that the same set of CPUs would be used in each node.

Each of the resource pools was assigned to a different workload group, to optimize hardware utilization. The reason is that Soft-NUMA and CPU affinity cannot divide physical memory in the physical NUMA nodes; therefore, by definition all soft NUMA nodes that are based on the same physical NUMA node must use memory in the same OS memory block. In other words, there is no
memory-to-processor affinity.

The following process was used to create this configuration:

1. Reduce the amount of memory allocated by default to SQL Server.

2. Create four new pools for running the R jobs in parallel.

3. Create four workload groups such that each workload group is associated with a resource pool.

4. Restart Resource Governor with the new workload groups and assignments.

5. Create a user-defined classifier function (UDF) to assign different tasks on different workload groups.

6. Update the Resource Governor configuration to use the function for appropriate workload groups.

> If a table is specified in the data source instead of a query, R Services uses internal heuristics to determines the necessary columns to fetch from the table; however, this approach is unlikely to result in parallel execution.

To ensure that the data can be analyzed in parallel, the query used to retrieve the data should be framed in such a way that the database engine can create a parallel query plan. If the code or algorithm uses large volumes of data, make sure that the query given to `RxSqlServerData` is optimized for parallel execution. A query that does not result in a parallel execution plan can result in a single process for computation.

If you need to work with large datasets, use Management Studio or another SQL query analyzer before you run your R code, to analyze the execution plan. Then, take any recommended steps to improve the performance of the query. For example, a missing index on a table can affect the time taken to execute a query. For more information, see [Monitor and Tune for Performance--../../relational-databases/performance/monitor-and-tune-for-performance.md).

Another common mistake that can affect performance is that a query retrieves more columns than are required. For example, if a formula is based on only three columns, but your source table has 30 columns, you are moving data unnecessarily.

 + Avoid using `SELECT *`!
 + Take some time to review the columns in the dataset and identify only the ones needed for analysis
 + Remove from your queries any columns that contain data types that are incompatible with R code, such as GUIDS and rowguids
 + Check for unsupported date and time formats
 + Rather than load a table, create a view that selects certain values or casts columns to avoid conversion errors

### 7. &nbsp; [R package management for SQL Server](r/r-package-management-for-sql-server-r-services.md)

*Updated: 2017-08-23* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ([Previous](#TitleNum_6) | [Next](#TitleNum_8))

This topic describes the package management features that you can use to manage R packages that are running on an instance of SQL Server.

**Applies to:** SQL Server 2016 R Services, SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services

**Package management using T-SQL**


You can continue to install R packages as an administrator on the computer, if you have those privileges, and if you are the only person using the server for machine learning jobs.

However, if you need to share packages with others, or if multiple people need to run machine learning jobs on the server, it is more efficient to set up a shared package library. SQL Server supports this through database roles.

The database administrator is responsible for setting up roles and adding users to the roles. Through roles, the database administrator can control who has permission to add or remove R packages from the SQL Server environment, and can audit package installation.

**Database roles for package management**


The following new database roles support secure installation and R package management in SQL Server:

- `rpkgs-users`: Allows users to use any shared packages that were installed by members of the `rpkgs-shared` role.

- `rpkgs-private`: Provides access to shared packages with the same permissions as the `rpkgs-users` role. Members of this role can also install, remove and use privately scoped packages.

-  `rpkgs-shared`: Provides the same permissions as the `rpkgs-private` role. Users who are members of this role can also install or remove shared packages.

- `db_owner`: Has the same permissions as the `rpkgs-shared` role. Can also grant users the right to install or remove both shared and private packages.

**Creating an external package library using T-SQL**


In addition, SQL Server 2017 supports the T-SQL statement, **CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY**, to support management by database administrator of external libraries. Currently you can use this statement to create Windows-based libraries for R. Additional support is planned in future for Python packages, and for packages written for execution on other platforms, such as Linux.

If you create an R solution on a data science client computer and need to run code by using the SQL Server computer as the compute context, you can use either a SQL login or integrated Windows authentication.

* For SQL logins: Ensure that the login has appropriate permissions on the database where you will be reading data. You can do so by adding *Connect to* and *SELECT* permissions, or by adding the login to the *db_datareader* role. For logins that need to create objects, add *DDL_admin* rights. For logins that must save data to tables, add the login to the *db_datawriter* role.

* For Windows authentication: You might need to configure an ODBC data source on the data science client that specifies the instance name and other connection information. For more information, see [ODBC data source administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator).

**Next steps**


After you have verified that the script-execution feature works in SQL Server, you can run R and Python commands from SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other client that can send T-SQL statements to the server.

However, you might want to make some changes to the system configuration to support heavy use of machine learning, or add new R packages.

This section lists some common modifications you can make to support machine learning.

**Add more worker accounts**


If you think you might use R heavily, or if you expect many users to be running scripts concurrently, you can increase the number of worker accounts that are assigned to the Launchpad service. For more information, see [Modify the user account pool for SQL Server R Services--modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

If the query returns a single memory node (node 0), either you do not have hardware NUMA, or the hardware is configured as interleaved (non-NUMA). SQL Server also ignores hardware NUMA when there four or fewer CPUs, or if at least one node has only one CPU.

If your computer has multiple processors but does not have hardware-NUMA, you can also use [Soft-NUMA](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/soft-numa-sql-server) to subdivide CPUs into smaller groups.  In both SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017, the Soft-NUMA feature is automatically enabled when starting the SQL Server service.

When Soft-NUMA is enabled, SQL Server automatically manages the nodes for you; however, to optimize for specific workloads, you can disable _soft affinity_ and manually configure CPU affinity for the soft NUMA nodes. This can give you more control over which workloads are assigned to which nodes, particularly if you are using an edition of SQL Server that supports resource governance. By specifying CPU affinity and aligning resource pools with groups of CPUs, you can reduce latency, and ensure that related processes are performed within the same NUMA node.

The overall process for configuring soft-NUMA and CPU affinity to support R workloads is as follows:

1. Enable soft-NUMA, if available
2. Define processor affinity
3. Create resource pools for external processes, using [Resource Governor--../r/resource-governance-for-r-services.md)
4. Assign the [workload groups--../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-workload-group.md) to specific affinity groups

- Configure the SQL Server instance to balance database engine operations and R or Python script execution at appropriate levels. This can include changing SQL Server defaults for memory and CPU usage, NUMA and processor affinity settings, and creation of resource groups.

- Optimize the server computer to support efficient use of external scripts. This can include increasing the number of accounts used for external script execution, enabling package management, and assigning users to related security roles.

- Applying optimizations specific to data storage and transfer in SQL Server, including indexing and statistics strategies, query design and query optimization, and the design of tables that are used for machine learning. You might also analyze data sources and data transport methods, or modify ETL processes to optimize feature extraction.

- Tune the analytical model to avoid inefficiencies. The scope of the optimizations that are possible depend on the complexity of your R code and the packages and data you are using. Key tasks include eliminating costly data transformations or offloading data preparation or feature engineering tasks from R or Python to ETL processes or SQL. You might also refactor scripts, eliminate in-line package installs, divide R code into separate procedures for training, scoring, and evaluation, or simplify code to work more efficiently as a stored procedure.

[Predict how and when to contact leads](https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-campaign-optimization/)

**What:** This solution uses insurance industry data to predict leads based on demographics, historical response data, and product-specific details.  Recommendations are also generated to indicate the best channel and time to approach users to influence purchase behavior.

**How:** The solution creates and compares multiple models. The solution also demonstrates automated data integration and data preparation using stored procedures. Parallel samples are provided for SQL Server in-database, in Azure, and HDInsight Spark.

**Health care: predict length of stay in hospital**


[Predicting length of stay in hospitals](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Solution/Predicting-Length-of-Stay-in-Hospitals-1)

**What:** Accurately predicting which patients might require long-term hospitalization is an important part of both care and planning. Administrators need to be able to determine which facilities require more resources, and caregivers want to guarantee that they can meet the needs of patients.

**How:** This solution uses the Data Science Virtual Machine, and includes an instance of SQL Server with machine learning enabled. It also includes a set of Power BI reports that you can use to interact with a deployed model.

**Customer churn**


[Customer churn prediction template (SQL Server R Services)](https://github.com/Microsoft/SQL-Server-R-Services-Samples/blob/master/Churn/Introduction.md)

**What:** Analyzing and predicting customer churn is important in any industry where the loss of customers to competitors must be managed and prevented:  banking, telecommunications, and retail, to name a few. The goal of churn analysis is to identify which customers are likely to churn, and then take appropriate actions to retain such customers and keep their business.

> Machine learning services, including use of R or Python, are currently not supported when running SQL Server on Linux, or in Azure SQL database. Look for changes in a later release.
>
> However, native scoring using the PREDICT function is currently supported in the Linux edition.

**In-database Python integration**


You can run Python in stored procedures, or execute Python remotely using the SQL Server computer as the compute context. This integration opens up new avenues for the vast community of Python developers and data scientists to use the power of SQL Server, and to explore innovations from Microsoft such as **revoscalepy** and **microsoftml**.

SQL Server developers gain access to the extensive Python libraries from the open source ecosystem, including popular frameworks such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Caffe and Theano/Keras.

But running Python in-database isn't just for machine learning; there are a myriad of other potential applications for integrating Python with SQL, leveraging the strengths of the respective languages to deliver more intelligent, powerful solutions.

+ **revoscalepy**

    This release includes the final version of **revoscalepy**, which supplies Pythonic equivalents of the scalable, streaming algorithms in RevoScaleR. You can create Python models for linear and logistic regressions, decision trees, boosted trees, and random forests, all parallelizable, and capable of being run in remote compute contexts.

    For more information, see [What is revoscalepy--python/what-is-revoscalepy.md).

+ Remote compute contexts for Python

    This release supports use of multiple data sources and remote compute contexts. The data scientist or developer can execute Python code on a remote SQL Server, to explore data or build models without moving data. Use of remote compute contexts requires **revoscalepy**.
