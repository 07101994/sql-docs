# SQL Server on Linux

SQL Server vNext CTP1 now runs on Linux. This content set focuses on what you need to know to use SQL Server on Linux. In many ways, SQL Server on Linux is simply SQL Server. It is the same SQL Server database engine, and many features and services work the same regardless of your operating system. 

For more information about the platforms and features supported in this release, see the [Release Notes](sql-server-linux-release-notes.md).

To begin using SQL Server on Linux, see the topics in the [Get started](sql-server-linux-get-started-tutorial.md) section.
