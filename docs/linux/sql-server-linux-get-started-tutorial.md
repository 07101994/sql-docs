# Get started with SQL Server on Linux

This topic provides a walkthrough on how to get started using SQL Server vNext CTP1 on Linux. This guide does not assume that you have experience with either Linux or SQL Server. If you do have a background in either area, you can scan this topic to find any additional information or links to resources.

## Install Linux
If you do not already have a Linux machine, you'll need to install Linux on either a physical server or a virtual machine (VM). 

TODO: explain the options including Azure...link to third-party pages for supported distributions.

## Install SQL Server
TODO: provide links to the installation guides.

## Connect locally or remotely
TODO: provide links to the connection topics and talk about local and remote connectivity

## Create a database
TODO: provide the T-SQL for creating a database. Point to restore article that installs the AdventureWorks sample DB.

## Explore SQL Server capabilities on Linux
TODO: provide links to the main SQL Server documentation, maybe a table of the most popular ones with links and descriptions. Link to supportability topic here too for guidance on understanding how to read the main documentation set in relation to SQL Server.

## Next Steps
TODO: point to other topics in this content set.
