> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial was meant to walk people through an end-to-end experience. But it might get repetitive with the breakout topics for install and connect and query. So instead it might provide a walk through that points to those other sections like a learning map. In this case it might act more as a top-level orientation topic in this section of content.
