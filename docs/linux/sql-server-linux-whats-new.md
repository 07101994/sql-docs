# What's new for SQL Server vNext on Linux

This topic describes what's new for SQL Server vNext running on Linux.

Many database engine improvements apply to both Windows and Linux. The only exception would be for database engine features that are currently not supported on Linux. For more information, see [What's New in SQL Server vNext (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt775028).
