# Connect applications to SQL Server on Linux
SQL Server vNext CTP1 running on Linux supports many different application languages and frameworks. If you are currently developing Windows applications for SQL Server, you can use the same code to target SQL Server on Linux. If you are developing database applications for Linux, you can developer native Linux applications that target SQL Server databases.
