>[!NOTE]
>When you create the resource, the SQL Server resource agent sets `REQUIRED_SYNCHRONIZED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT`. The default setting is calculated, depending on the availability group configuration. This affects both automatic failover and data protection. If you are using three nodes - one primary and two synchronous replicas - the value is set to `1`. For details and additional configuration options, see [High availability and data protection for availability group configurations](..\linux\sql-server-linux-availability-group-ha.md).
