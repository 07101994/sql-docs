### Join secondary SQL Servers to the availability group

The following Transact-SQL script joins a server to an availability group named `ag1`. Update the script for your environment. On each secondary SQL Server replica, run the following Transact-SQL to join the availability group.

```Transact-SQL
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE);
		 
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
```

## Add a database to the availability group

Ensure the database you are adding to the Availability group is in full recovery mode and has a valid log backup. If this is a test database or a new database created, take a database backup. On the primary SQL Server, run the following Transact-SQL to create and back up a database called `db1`.

```Transact-SQL
CREATE DATABASE [db1];
ALTER DATABASE [db1] SET RECOVERY FULL;
BACKUP DATABASE [db1] TO DISK = N'NUL';
```

On the primary SQL Server replica, run the following Transact-SQL to add a database called `db1` to an availability group called `ag1`.

```Transact-SQL
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] ADD DATABASE [db1];
```

### Verify that the database is created on the secondary servers

On each secondary SQL Server replica, run the following query to see if the `db1` database has been created and is synchronized.

```Transact-SQL
SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'db1';
GO
SELECT DB_NAME(database_id) AS 'database', synchronization_state_desc FROM sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states;
```

## Notes

**The availability group is not a clustered resource at this point.** 

   If you followed the steps in this document, you have an availability group that is not yet clustered. The next step is to add the cluster. While this is a valid configuration in read-scale/load balancing scenarios, it is not valid for HADR. To achieve HADR, you need to add the availability group as a cluster resource. See [Next steps](#next-steps) for instructions. 
   
   While the availability group is not in a cluster, note the following behaviors:

   - If the primary replica goes down and comes back up - for example if the SQL Server instance or node restarts the availability group will go in `RESOLVING` state. A database restart does not trigger the availability group to go into a `RESOLVING` state. Only an instance restart triggers availability group state evaluation. Because there is no cluster controller to manage the availability group elect one of replicas as primary, you need to manually fail over the availability group. To do this, run `ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP FAILOVER` on the replica that you choose as primary. You can run `ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP FAILOVER` on any the former primary replica or any secondary replica. Note the following behavior:
      - If you run this on the former primary replica then previous configuration returns.
      - If you run this on a secondary replica then the rest of replicas - including the former PRIMARY - will automatically join the availability group.
      
   - During failover a cluster manager ensures that the demotion action is completed before the promotion action starts so that there will not be two primary replicas in the configuration. On Windows, WSFC is the cluster manager. On a Linux cluster, Pacemaker can be the cluster manager. Without a cluster manager, you have to manually demote the primary replica and promote the secondary replicas in sequential order. If you initiate a failover without a cluster manager, there is no guarantee the demotion is successful - if the primary replica is unresponsive, for example - but promotion can succeed. To avoid having two primary replicas if the demotion fails, you can complete the manual fail over in two steps. First demote the primary replica, and then promote the secondary replica. 
      1. Demote the current primary. On the primary SQL Server replica, run the following query:
         ```Transact-SQL
         ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] SET (ROLE = SECONDARY);
         ```
      1. Promote the current secondary to new primary. On the node that you want to promote run the following query:
         ```Transact-SQL
         ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] FAILOVER;
         ```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>After you configure the cluster and add the availability group as a cluster resource, you cannot use Transact-SQL to fail over the availability group resources. SQL Server cluster resources on Linux are not coupled as tightly with the operating system as they are on a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC). SQL Server service is not aware of the presence of the cluster. All orchestration is done through the cluster management tools. In RHEL or Ubuntu use `pcs`. In SLES use `crm`. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the availability group is a cluster resource, there is a known issue in current release where forced failover with data loss to an asynchronous replica does not work. This will be fixed in the upcoming release. Manual or automatic failover to a synchronous replica will succeed.
