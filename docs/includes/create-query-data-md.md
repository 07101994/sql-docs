## Create and query data
The following sections walk you through using **sqlcmd** and Transact-SQL to create a new database, add data, and run a simple query.

### Create a new database

The following steps create a new database named `TestDB`.

1. From the **sqlcmd** command prompt, paste the following Transact-SQL command to create a test database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE TestDB
   ```

1. On the next line, write a query to return the name of all of the databases on your server:

   ```sql
   SELECT Name from sys.Databases
   ```

1. The previous two commands were not executed immediately. You must type `GO` on a new line to execute the previous commands:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Insert data

Next create a new table, `Inventory`, and insert two new rows.

1. From the **sqlcmd** command prompt, switch context to the new `TestDB` database:

   ```sql
   USE TestDB
   ```

1. Create new table named `Inventory`:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Inventory (id INT, name NVARCHAR(50), quantity INT)
   ```

1. Insert data into the new table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Inventory VALUES (1, 'banana', 150); INSERT INTO Inventory VALUES (2, 'orange', 154);
   ```

1. Type `GO` to execute the previous commands:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Select data

Now, run a query to return data from the `Inventory` table.

1. From the **sqlcmd** commandd prompt, enter a query that returns rows from the `Inventory` table where the quantity is greater than 152:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE quantity > 152;
   ```

1. Execute the command:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Exit the sqlcmd command prompt

To end your **sqlcmd** session, type `QUIT`:

```sql
QUIT
```
