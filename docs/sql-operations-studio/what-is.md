# What is [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos.md)]?

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] is a free, light-weight tool for managing your databases.

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can connect to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse databases wherever they're running; Windows, Linux, Azure, VMs, AWS, Google cloud, containers, etc.

## Transact-SQL (T-SQL) code editor with IntelliSense

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] offers a modern, keyboard-focused T-SQL coding experience that makes your everyday tasks easier with built-in features, such as multiple tab windows, a rich T-SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets, code navigation, and source control integration (Git). Run on-demand T-SQL queries, view and save results as text, JSON, or Excel, edit data, organize your favorite database connections, and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience. To learn about the T-SQL editor, see []().

## Smart T-SQL code snippets

To quickly create copies of your database for development or testing purposes, generate and execute CREATE and INSERT scripts. Use customizable T-SQL code snippets to create new databases and database objects (tables, views, stored procedures, users, logins, roles, etc.) and to update existing database objects. To learn about using T-SQL code snippets, see [Create and use code snippets](code-snippets.md).


## Customizable Server and Database Dashboards featuring Insightful monitoring widgets

Create rich customizable dashboards to monitor and quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks in your databases. To learn about insight widgets, and database (and server) dashboards, see [Manage servers and databases with Insight widgets in [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)]](insight-widgets.md).


## Integrated Terminal

Use your favorite command-line tools (for example, Bash, PowerShell, sqlcmd, bcp, and ssh) in the Integrated Terminal window right within the [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] user interface. To learn about the integrated terminal, see [Integated termina] (integrated-terminal.md).
