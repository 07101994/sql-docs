# Overview of Carbon

## Section here H2 
Carbon is a free lightweight database development and operations tool that is designed from the ground up to supports a variety of databases running on-premise or any cloud, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Warehouse, and SQL Server. .  It offers a consistent experience across various SQL and Azure databases and can run on your favorite operating system, including Windows, Linux and MacOs. The source code for Carbon is available on Github,enabling Microsoft partners and the community at large to build and contribute to the product. Users can add support for additional data sources, fix bugs and extend features via pull requests. 


Carbon offers a lightweight, keyboard focused modern code workflow experience when working with SQL and PostgreSQL. We’ve made your everyday tasks easier with built-in features, such as multiple tab windows, a rich SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets & code navigation, and source control integration (Git and TFS). You can execute ad-hoc queries, view & save results as text, JSON or Excel, edit data, organize & manage your favorite database connections and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience. 
  

Use your favorite command line tools (e.g. Bash, PowerShell, sqlcmd, bcp, psql and ssh) in the Integrated Terminal window right within the Carbon user interface. Easily generate and execute CREATE and INSERT scripts for your database objects to create copies of your database for development or testing purposes. Boost your productivity with smart code snippets and rich graphical experiences that can create new databases and database objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures, users, logins, roles, etc.) or update existing database objects. Use rich customizable dashboards to monitor and quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks in your databases on-premises, in Azure or any cloud. 


Carbon offers a consistent experience to backup and restore your databases. With planned support for SQL Server Always On Availability Groups, you can easily configure, monitor and troubleshoot AGs for your mission-critical SQL Server databases and quickly failover to a secondary database in the event of a disaster. 
  
Carbon has been designed from the ground up to make you more productive in the DevOps lifecycle of your databases of choice on the operating systems of your choice. You are always in control, making it easier to reduce risks, to solve problems faster, and to continuously deliver value to your users.
