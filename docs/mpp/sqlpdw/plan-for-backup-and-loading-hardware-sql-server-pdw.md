# Plan for Backup and Loading Hardware (SQL Server PDW)
To deploy your end-to-end SQL Server PDW data warehousing solution, you need to create plans for backup and loading. Use this guidance to acquire and configure backup and loading servers that will meet your business requirements.  
  
## Acquire and Configure Backup Servers

To backup a SQL Server PDW database, you need one or more backup servers. You can use your own existing hardware or purchase new hardware. For more information, see [Acquire and Configure a Backup Server &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/acquire-and-configure-a-backup-server-sql-server-pdw.md). These instructions include a [Backup Server Capacity Planning Worksheet &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/backup-server-capacity-planning-worksheet-sql-server-pdw.md) to help you plan the right solution for backup.

To load data, you need one or more loading servers. You can use your own existing ETL or other servers, or you can purchase new servers. For more information, see [Acquire and Configure a Loading Server &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/acquire-and-configure-a-loading-server-sql-server-pdw.md). These instructions include a [Loading Server Capacity Planning Worksheet &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/loading-server-capacity-planning-worksheet-sql-server-pdw.md) to help you plan the right solution for loading.
