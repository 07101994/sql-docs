# Change a login to the default system resources for its requests
Describes how to change the system resource allocations assigned to a SQL Server PDW login to the default amounts. This affects the system resources that SQL Server PDW assigns to requests submitted by the login.  
  
For resource class descriptions, see [Workload Management &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../../mpp/sqlpdw/workload-management-sql-server-pdw.md)  
  
## Use the default level of system resources  
When a login is not a member of any resource class server role, requests submitted by the login will receive the default amount of system resources.  
  
Suppose the login Matt is currently a member of all resource class server roles and wants to revert back to having his requests receive only the default resources.  The following example assigns the default resources to Mattâ€™s requests by dropping his membership from all three resource class server roles.  
  
```  
--Give the requests submitted by Matt the default system resources   
--by dropping Matt from all resource class server roles.  
ALTER SERVER ROLE XLargeRC DROP MEMBER Matt;  
ALTER SERVER ROLE LargeRC DROP MEMBER Matt;  
ALTER SERVER ROLE MediumRC DROP MEMBER Matt;  
```
