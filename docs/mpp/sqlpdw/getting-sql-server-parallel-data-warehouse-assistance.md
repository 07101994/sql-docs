# Getting SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse Assistance
There are three principal sources of information from Microsoft about SQL Server PDW:  
  
-   The documentation installed with SQL Server PDW.  
  
-   The SQL Server sites on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) and TechNet.  
  
-   SQL Server PDW information on additional Microsoft Web sites.  
  
If you do not find the information you are looking for in these sources, you can either post questions in the SQL Server community forums and newsgroups, or you can open a support case with Microsoft.  
  
## SQL Server Documentation  
When you install SQL Server PDW, you can install the SQL Server PDW documentation, which covers the concepts and procedures required to use SQL Server effectively. It also includes reference material for the languages and programming interfaces for storing, retrieving, reporting, and modifying data using SQL Server PDW.  
  
## Information on MSDN and TechNet  
The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) provides online and offline services that help developers write applications using Microsoft products and technologies. The Microsoft TechNet Program delivers comprehensive technical resources that help IT professionals efficiently evaluate, deploy, and support Microsoft solutions.  
  
Several sites on MSDN and TechNet provide a specific audience with links to the SQL Server information most relevant to their jobs, including the information in the copies of the SQL Server Books Online on MSDN or TechNet. These sites also contain information that extends the information available in the Books Online.

## Getting Assistance From Others  
If you have not found the information you are looking for in the product documentation or on the Web you can ask a question in the SQL Server community forums and newsgroups. You can also request help from product support.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Please do not post questions in the Community Comments section at the bottom of the SQL Server Books Online topics in the MSDN Library or TechNet Library. Those sections are not monitored for questions, and you will usually not receive an answer. Please post questions in the community forums and newsgroups, which are monitored by other customers who can answer your questions.
