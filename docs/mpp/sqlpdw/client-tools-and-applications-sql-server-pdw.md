## <a name="limits"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
For SQL Server compatibility, SQL Server PDW reports the SQL Server product version by using a SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 2 version number. Therefore, tools that connect to PDW as an instance of SQL Server will use operations that are compatible with SQL Server 2008. For more information, see Client Tools entry in [Minimum and Maximum Values &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/minimum-and-maximum-values-sql-server-pdw.md).  
  
## <a name="access"></a>Accessibility Notice  
The Admin Console and dwloader applications meet Microsoft's standard for interacting with the application with the mouse and keyboard both together and independently. These applications support high-contrast displays and support accessibility assistance applications such as Narrator. These applications have multiple methods of interaction with the user interface and that the presentation of information is unambiguous and in multiple formats to ensure that regardless of customer needs the experience is consistent and without limit or restrictions.
