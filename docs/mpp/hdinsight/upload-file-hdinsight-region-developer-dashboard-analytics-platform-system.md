# Upload File - HDInsight Region Developer Dashboard (Analytics Platform System)
Use the **Upload File** page of the HDInsight Developer Dashboard to upload a JAR containing Hive UDFs that you want to use in Hive queries. To upload a file:  
  
## Upload File  
![APS HDI Developer Dashboard Upload File](../hdinsight/media/APS_HDI_DevDashboard_UploadFile.png "APS_HDI_DevDashboard_UploadFile")  
  
-   Navigate to the **File Upload** page, click on the **Upload** tab, select **Source** (on the userâ€™s local file system) and **Destination** (the absolute path in HDFS where the file will reside), and then to click **Upload**.  
  
If the file already exists, a warning dialog box opens providing an opportunity to overwrite the file.  
  
The file will be copied to the selected path in HDFS. After the operation is done, the status message is displayed to the user.
