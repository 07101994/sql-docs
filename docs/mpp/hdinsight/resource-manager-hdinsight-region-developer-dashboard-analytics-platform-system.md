# Resource Manager - HDInsight Region Developer Dashboard (Analytics Platform System)
Use the Resource Manager page of the HDInsight Developer Dashboard to gain more insight and detailed information about job history, job tracker and task tracker logs.  
  
## Resource Manager  
![APS HDI Developer Dashboard Resource Manager](../hdinsight/media/APS_HDI_DevDashboard_MapReduceUI.png "APS_HDI_DevDashboard_MapReduceUI")  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> This graphic represents only a portion of the available information.  
  
When jobs are retired after they become invisible to **WebHCat** (and Job History) but they will still be visible from the **Map Reduce UI** page.  
  
This page is part of Apache Hadoop and is exposed in the Developer Dashboard without any changes made by Microsoft.
