# HDInsight  (Analytics Platform System)
HDInsight is one of the Analytics Platform System workloads. Use HDInsight on Analytics Platform System to create your own on-premises Hadoop solution, and to quickly integrate and analyze HDInsight data with SQL Server PDW data since all of the data is stored in close proximity on the same appliance.

## HDInsight Benefits  
Microsoft HDInsight is a 100 percent Apache Hadoop-based data platform that provides a Hadoop-based cloud solution for Azure services, and an on-premises solution for Analytics Platform System. HDInsight manages data of any type, whether relational or nonrelational, and of any size. With APS, you can store and analyze HDInsight data on your own premises.  
  
With APS, you can perform more complex analysis faster by using SQL Server PDW’s PolyBase to integrate analysis of your HDInsight non-relational data and your SQL Server PDW relational data, all on the same appliance.  
  
HDInsight, running on APS, makes it easy to:  
  
-   Load data of any structure into SQL Server PDW. By first loading your data into HDInsight, you can transform and process it, and then use PDW’s PolyBase to quickly load the data into SQL Server PDW relational tables.  
  
-   Perform fast integrated analysis of HDInsight data and PDW data. The data are stored within close proximity of each other on the same appliance, making it fast to run integrated analysis with PDW’s PolyBase.  
  
-   Export relational data to HDInsight region for a *cold data* store. To reduce the size of data stored in SQL Server PDW, you can move it to HDInsight and query the data at any time.  
  
-   Trust that your data will be protected with the Analytics Platform System built-in high availability.  
  
-   Monitor and manage HDInsight by using centralized appliance management tools.
