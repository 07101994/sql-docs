# Name Node - HDInsight Region Developer Dashboard (Analytics Platform System)
**Namenode** allows you to browse the file system from the Developer Dashboard and get insight into name node logs. It is also possible to explore via **WebHDFS**, however the **Name Node** page is generally more convenient for manual browsing.  
  
## Name Node
