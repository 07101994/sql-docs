# Behavior Changes to Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2017
  A *behavior change* affects how features work or interact in the current version as compared to earlier versions of SQL Server. Revisions to  default values, manual configuration required to complete an upgrade or restore functionality, or a new implementation of an existing feature are all examples of a behavior change in the product.  
 
 There are no behavior changes between Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2016 and Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2017
