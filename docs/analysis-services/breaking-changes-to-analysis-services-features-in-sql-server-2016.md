# Breaking Changes to Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2017
  A *breaking change* causes a data model, application code, or script  to no longer function after upgrading either the model or the server.  
 
 There are no breaking changes between SQL Server 2016 Analysis Services and SQL Server 2017 Analysis Services.
