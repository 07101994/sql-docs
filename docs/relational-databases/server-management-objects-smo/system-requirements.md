# System Requirements
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) uses the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] **System.Data.SqlClient** object driver to connect to and communicate with instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 SMO requires [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 4.0 to run, so any applications using it must ensure that client machines have that version or higher installed.
