# Automatic tuning
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssvNxt-asdb-xxxx-xxx](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssvnxt-asdb-xxxx-xxx.md)]  

  Automatic tuning is a database feature that provides insight into potential query performance problems, recommend solutions, and automatically fix identified problems.

Automatic tuning in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], notifies you whenever a potential performance issue is detected, and lets you apply corrective actions, or lets the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] automatically fix performance problems.

## Forcing last good plan

[!INCLUDE[ssdenoversion_md](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)] may use different SQL plans to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] queries. Query plans depend on the statistics, indexes, and other factors, so the optimal plan that should be used to execute some [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] query might be changed over time. In some cases, new plan might not be better than the previous one, and this might cause a performance regression.
In order to prevent unexpected performance issues, users must periodically monitor system and look for the queries that regressed. If any plan regressed, user should find some previous good plan and force it instead of the current one. The best practice would be to force last known good plan because older plans might be invalid due to statistic or index changes.
When user forces last known good plan, he should monitor performance of the query that is executed using the forced plan and verify that forced plan works as expected. Depending on the results of monitoring and analysis, plan should be forced or user should find some other way to optimize the query.
Manually forced plans should not be forced forever, because the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] should be able to apply optimal plans. The user or DBA should eventually unforce the plan and let the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] find the optimal plan.

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides all necessary views and procedures required to monitor performance and fix problems in Query Store. However, continuous monitoring and fixing performance issues might be a tedious process.

### Automatic plan change regression detection

In [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] detects and shows potential plan choice regressions and the recommended actions that should be applied in the **sys.dm\_db\_tuning\_recommendations** view. The view shows information about the problem, the importance of the issue, and details such as the identified query, the id of the regressed plan, the id of the plan that was used as baseline for comparison, and the [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] statement that can be executed to fix the problem.

| type | description | datetime | score | details | â€¦ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FORCE\_LAST\_GOOD\_PLAN | CPU time changed from 4ms to 14ms | 3/17/2017 | 83% | {queryId,forcedPlanId,regressedPlanId,T-SQL} |   |
| FORCE\_LAST\_GOOD\_PLAN | CPU time changed from 37ms to 84ms | 3/16/2017 | 26% | {queryId,forcedPlanId,regressedPlanId,T-SQL} |   |

The most important information shown in this view are:
 - Type of the recommended action - `FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN`.
 - Description that contains informations why [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] thinks that this is potential performance regression.
 - Datetime when the potential regression is detected.
 - Score of this. 
 - Details about the issues such as id of the detected plan, id of the regressed plan, id of the plan that should be forced to fix the issue, [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] script that might be applied to fix the issue, etc.

Use the following query to obtain a script which will fix the issue:

```   
SELECT description, score,
      JSON_VALUE(details, '$.implementationDetails.TSql') correction_script,
      planForceDetails.*
FROM sys.dm_db_tuning_recommendations
  CROSS APPLY OPENJSON (Details, '$.planForceDetails')
    WITH (  [query_id] int '$.queryId',
            [regressed_plan_id] int '$.regressedPlanId',
            [forced_plan_id] int '$.forcedPlanId'
          ) as planForceDetails;
```

## Automatic plan choice correction

In addition to detection, the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] can automatically switch to the last known good plan whenever the regression is detected. The user can enable automatic tuning per database and specify that last good plan should be forced whenever some plan change regression is detected. Automatic tuning is enabled using the following command:

```   
ALTER DATABASE current
SET AUTOMATIC_TUNING ( FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN = ON ); 
```

When the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] applies a recommendation, it automatically monitors the performance of the forced plan and if the forced plan is better than regressed plan it will remain forced until a recompile (e.g. on next statistics or schema change). If the forced plan is not better than the regressed plan, the new plan will be unforced and the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] will compile a new plan.

The status of advisor is shown in the following view:

```    
SELECT *
FROM sys.database_automatic_tuning_options;
```
[!INCLUDE[ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]     

| name | desired\_state | desired\_state\_desc | actual\_state | actual\_state\_desc | reason\_code | reason\_desc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FORCE\_LAST\_GOOD\_PLAN | 1 | ON | 0 | ON | 0 | NULL |

FORCE\_LAST\_GOOD\_PLAN option might be in OFF state even if the user specified ON. The option might be disabled if Query Store is disabled or in read-only mode. Columns `[actual_state` and `actual_state_desc` give information about the current state of automatic tuning option, and columns `reason_code` and `reason_desc` give information why is actual state diferent that desired state. Values in `reason_code` and `reason_desc` columns are shown in the following table:

| reason\_code | reason\_desc | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | DISABLED | Option is disabled by system. |
| 11 | QUERY\_STORE\_OFF | Query Store is turned off. |
| 12 | QUERY\_STORE\_READ\_ONLY | Query Store is in read-only mode. |
| 13 | NOT\_SUPPORTED | Available only in Enterprise edition of SQL Server. |
