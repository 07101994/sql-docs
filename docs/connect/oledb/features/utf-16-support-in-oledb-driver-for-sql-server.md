# UTF-16 Support in OLE DB Driver for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], if you supply a fixed-length buffer when binding a column result or output parameter and if the **wchar** character written into the buffer before the terminating character is a high surrogate code point of a surrogate pair, and if the next **wchar** character is a low surrogate code point, OLE DB Driver for SQL Server will not add the high surrogate code point to the buffer.
