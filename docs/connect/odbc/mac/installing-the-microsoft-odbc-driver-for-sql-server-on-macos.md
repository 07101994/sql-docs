# Installing the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on Linux
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

This topic explains how to install the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame_md.md)] ODBC Driver 13.1 and 11 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] on Linux. 
  
## Installing the Microsoft ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server on macOS  

### OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
1. Install homebrew: 
    `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
3. Add msodbcsql tap: 
    `brew tap microsoft/msodbcsql https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-msodbcsql`
4. Update homebrew: 
    `brew update`
5. Install msodbcsql package: 
    `brew install msodbcsql`

## Troubleshooting Connection Problems  
If you are unable to make a connection to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] using the ODBC driver on macOS, use the following information to identify the problem.  
  
The most common connection problem is to have two copies of the UnixODBC Driver Manager installed. Search /usr for libodbc\*.so\*. If you see more than one version of the file, you (possibly) have more than one driver manager installed. Your application might use the wrong version. If you see the UnixODBC Driver Manager installed package when you execute (on Red Hat) the command **yum list unixODBC**, delete the package.  
  
Enable the connection log by verifying that your odbcinst.ini file contains the section and these items:  
  
```  
[ODBC]  
Trace = Yes  
TraceFile = (your log file)  
```  
  
If you get another connection failure and do not see a log file, there (possibly) are two copies of the driver manager on your computer. Otherwise, the log output should be similar to the following:  
  
```  
[ODBC][28783][1321576347.077780][SQLDriverConnectW.c][290]  
        Entry:  
            Connection = 0x17c858e0  
            Window Hdl = (nil)  
            Str In = [DRIVER={ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server};SERVER={contoso.com};Trusted_Connection={YES};WSID={mydb.contoso.com};AP...][length = 139 (SQL_NTS)]  
            Str Out = (nil)  
            Str Out Max = 0  
            Str Out Ptr = (nil)  
            Completion = 0  
        UNICODE Using encoding ASCII 'UTF8' and UNICODE 'UTF16LE'  
```  
  
If the character encoding is not UTF-8, for example:  
  
```  
UNICODE Using encoding ASCII 'ISO8859-1' and UNICODE 'UCS-2LE'  
```  
  
There is more than one Driver Manager installed and your application is using the wrong one. Or, the Driver Manager was not built correctly.
