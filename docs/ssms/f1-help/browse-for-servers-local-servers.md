# Browse for Servers (Local Servers)
When connecting to a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] component and you do not know the exact name of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)], in the **Server name** box, click **Browse for more**, to open the **Browse for Servers** dialog box.  
  
## Options  
**Select the server to connect to**  
Designate the server you want to connect to by clicking on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] instance displayed in the tree. You can show or hide portions of the tree view by clicking on the nodes marked with a **+** or **â€“** symbol.
