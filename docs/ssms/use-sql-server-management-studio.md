# Use SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] and Azure SQL Database. SSMS combines a broad group of graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide access to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] to developers and administrators of all skill levels.  
  
SSMS combines the features of Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, and Analysis Manager, included in previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)], into a single environment. In addition, SSMS works with all components of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] such as [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion_md.md)]. Developers get a familiar experience, and database administrators get a single comprehensive utility that combines easy-to-use graphical tools with rich scripting capabilities.
