# Quickstart: Connect and query SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio
This quickstart shows how to use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to SQL Server, and then use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) statements to create a database and insert rows into it. 

## Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, you need SQL Server Management Studio and access to a SQL Server. 

- Install [!INCLUDE[name-ssms]../includes/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md].

If you don't have access to a SQL Server, select your platform from the following links (make sure you remember your SQL Login and Password!):
- [Windows - Download SQL Server 2017 Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [macOS - Download SQL Server 2017 on Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker)
- [Linux - Download SQL Server 2017 Developer Edition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-overview#install) - You only need to follow the steps up to *Create and Query Data*.

## Connect to a SQL Server

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. The first time  you run SSMS the **Connect to Server** dialog opens. 
   - If the **Connection** dialog doesn't open, Object Explorer > Connect button / connect icon > Database Engine.

3. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, select your connection options and hit connect. This article uses *Windows Authentication* but *SQL Login* is also supported. The remaining fields should be as follows:
   - Server type: Database Engine (should be selected by default)
   - Authentication: Windows Authentication
   - Options: you can also modify your connection options, such as the database you're connecting to, the connection timeout value, and the network protocol, but for the purpose of this quickstart, we're leaving everything as default.

4. You are now connected to your SQL Server, and  you can verify this by exploring the objects available within Object Explorer: 
   ![Connected to SQL][media/QuickStartConnect/SuccessfulConnection.png]


## Create a database
The following steps create a database named TutorialDB. 

1. Right click your sersver in **Object Explorer** and select **New Query**. 
   ![New Query][media/QuickStartConnect/NewQuery.png]
2. Paste the following snippet into the query window: 


   ```sql
   USE master
   GO
   IF NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT name
      FROM sys.databases
      WHERE name = N'TutorialDB'
   )
   CREATE DATABASE [TutorialDB]
   GO

   ALTER DATABASE [TutorialDB] SET QUERY_STORE=ON
   GO
   ```

3. To execute the query, highlight the text you want to run and hit Execute (or F5 on your keyboard). If you want to execute everything in the window at once, then hit Execute without highlighting anything.  
   ![Execute Query][media/QuickStartConnect/Execute.png]

   After the query completes, the new **TutorialDB** appears in the list of databases. If you donâ€™t see it, right click the Databases node and select **Refresh**.  

## Create a Table
The query editor is still connected to the *master* database, but we want to create a table in the *TutorialDB*. 

1. Change the connection context of your query from the master to **TutorialDB** by selecting the database you want from the drop down on the top left. 
   ![Change Database][media/QuickStartConnect/ChangeDB.png]
2. Paste the following snippet into the query window, hightlight it, and hit **Execute**: 
  
   ```sql
   -- Create a new table called 'Customers' in schema 'dbo'
   -- Drop the table if it already exists
   IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Customers', 'U') IS NOT NULL
   DROP TABLE dbo.Customers
   GO
   -- Create the table in the specified schema
   CREATE TABLE dbo.Customers
   (
      CustomerId        INT    NOT NULL   PRIMARY KEY, -- primary key column
      Name      [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL,
      Location  [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL,
      Email     [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL
   );
   GO
   ```
After the query completes, the new **Customers** table appears in the list of tables. You might need to right-click the **TutorialDB > Tables** node and select **Refresh**.

## Insert rows
1. Paste the following snippet into the query window and **Execute**: 


   ```sql
   -- Insert rows into table 'Customers'
   INSERT INTO dbo.Customers
      ([CustomerId],[Name],[Location],[Email])
   VALUES
      ( 1, N'Orlando', N'Australia', N''),
      ( 2, N'Keith', N'India', N'keith0@adventure-works.com'),
      ( 3, N'Donna', N'Germany', N'donna0@adventure-works.com'),
      ( 4, N'Janet', N'United States', N'janet1@adventure-works.com')
   GO
   ```

## View the data returned by a query
1. Paste the following snippet into the query window and click **Execute**: 

   ```sql
   -- Select rows from table 'Customers'
   SELECT * FROM dbo.Customers;
   ```
2. The results of the query are displayed under the area where text was entered: 
   ![Query Results][media/QuickStartConnect/QueryResults.png]


3. You can modify the way results are presented by selecting one of these options
   ![Results][media/QuickStartConnect/Results.png]
   - By default, the results will be in **Grid**, which shows a table and is the middle option
   - The first option will display your results via text
   - The third option will save your results to a file

## Verify your query window connection properties
Information at the bottom of the query window displays information about your query connection properties, and the results of your query. 
1. Run the same query as above (this time the results are displayed as text as an example)
2. Review the connection settings at the bottom of the query window; they show the server and database you're currently connected to, and the user you're logged in with. You can also see the duration of the query and how many rows were returned. 
    ![Connection Properties][media/QuickStartConnect/ConnectionProperties.png]


## Change the server the query is connected to
If you need to quickly change the server your query is connected to, you can do so within the query window.
1. Right click within the query window > Connection > Change connection
2. This will open the **Connect to Server** dialog box again, allowing you to change which server your query is connected to
- Note that this does not change which server your object explorer is connected to, just the current query window.
