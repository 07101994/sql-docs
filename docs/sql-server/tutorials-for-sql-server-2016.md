# Tutorials for SQL Server 2016
[!INCLUDE[feedback_stackoverflow_msdn_connect-md](../includes/feedback-stackoverflow-msdn-connect-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] introduces many new technologies and features. Three new or significantly updated tutorials are available to help you get started quickly with [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
There are plans to plans to provide additional tutorials in the future. Meanwhile, you can continue to learn from the tutorials published for previous versions. In some cases, you might find minor differences between the user interface in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and previous versions, or there might be subtle differences in tutorial prerequisites. If a tutorial uses one of the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)] databases, you should download and use the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] version.  
  
If you are using a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] server, the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] data providers are installed. In order for the tutorials to work, you will either need the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] sample databases that work with those providers, or you need the  data providers that work with the previous version of the sample databases.  
  

  
-   Download a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook and [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] reports to use with [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] tutorials, go to [Power View Samples for SQL Server 2012](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=220734).  
- Check out the new [Wide World Importers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt734199(SQL.1).aspx) sample available on the [sql-server-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples) GitHub repository. 
    
-   Download [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] versions of [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)] databases, go to [AdventureWorks Databases and Scripts for SQL Server 2016 CTP3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49502) on CodePlex.
